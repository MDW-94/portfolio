# My Portfolio

This React App contains my portfolio which is a list of project, information about me & some links to my social media (including a downloadable resume)

# MVP

- User can visit a projects page, scroll-through, select and read about my projects
- User can use a searchbar function to find specific projects relevant to the searched programming language (EXT: project descriptions + names)
- User can be directed to an "About Me" page with a few profiles and text explaining my journey into programming - EXT: A carosel or image selection component of the profiles
- The Portfolio will adear to the WCAG guidelines - this would hopefully include ARIA tags for users who have access needs
- The User will be able to view the app on their mobile device without styling, or hindrance to information presented - EXT: this could include optional displays for readability

# EXT

- Use Spline & Cloud Resume Challenge in the development of your portfolio - remember accessibility!
- Use Blade Runner Palette Colours (remembering accessibility) for highlights and design
- Include music and photography examples as hobbies and interests

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
